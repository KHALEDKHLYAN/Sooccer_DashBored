## Application features: ‚öôÔ∏è
**Live Football World Cup Scoreboard** that shows matches and scores.

The board supports the following operations:

1. Start a game. When a game starts, it should capture (being initial score 0 ‚Äì 0):
    a. Home team
    b. Away team

2. Finish game. It will remove a match from the scoreboard.

3. Update score. Receiving the pair score; home team score and away team score updates a game score.

4. Get a summary of games by total score. Those games with the same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently added to our system.

‚úçÔ∏è As an example, being the current data in the system:

    a. Mexico - Canada: 0 - 5
    b. Spain - Brazil: 10 ‚Äì 2
    c. Germany - France: 2 ‚Äì 2
    d. Uruguay - Italy: 6 ‚Äì 6
    e. Argentina - Australia: 3 - 1

The summary would provide with the following information:

    1. Uruguay 6 - Italy 6
    2. Spain 10 - Brazil 2
    3. Mexico 0 - Canada 5
    4. Argentina 3 - Australia 1
    5. Germany 2 - France 2

  ### Possible Improvements üöÄ
    - Add a clock under the game status, say counting down the seconds, to make it look more like a real-time app
    - Add some animation to when updating the scores to make it easier for the user to spot the change
    - Add some interactivity in general:
        - Clicking on each game leading to a details pane with the match details
        - Option for selecting favourite team
    - Add another page/tab where the history summary of the past games can be read
